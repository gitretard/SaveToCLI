# SaveToCLI
My first shitty C/C++ program that can only store integers up to 2048 characters combined an up to 2048 arrays parts? to save to
Problems:
1.code efficiency so bad it can cause thermonuclear war
2.dogshit error handling
shows how bad ill be with even larger programs. doubt ill be able to do anything useful
also i tried to add header names for everything in the main araay failed so badly severe skill issue momen
also .length in C++ ver failed terriibly
This will be my last program ill publish before finishing the 4 hour course on girrafe academy.
